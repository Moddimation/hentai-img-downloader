# hentai-img-downloader
Downloads images in high quality from hentai-image.com, supports multitasking.
Every task will be put in a new folder, which can be merged later.

## Usage:

run "bash run.sh", NOT "sh run.sh".

Next you enter the website, make sure it matches following format:
https://hentai-img.com/image/{random-page-name}/

next you enter the amount of pages this specific upload has,
just scroll down and enter the number of the last page.

if it takes too long and doesnt make progress, try to 
- visit the link directly
- connect via vpn to another country (like japan)

once finished, you can find the images in its corresponding directory. you can run another task whenever you want, it will be created in another folder.

## Merging:

run "bash merge.sh" to get all images and put them into one single directory.

once thats done, you are finished!



dont ask why img.sh is seperate. im too lazy to merge it
